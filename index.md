This script is designed to run on a freshly deployed Windows EC2 instance. Its function is to make a request to the AWS Secrets Manager to get the proper Active Directory Service Account credentials of a user that has delegated control to perform domain join operations. This negates the necessity of having hard coded username and password values sitting in the unattend.xml or the accompanying windows domain join powerShell script saved within the base AMI. 


## Objectives

+ Create key/value pair in AWS Secrets
+ Create an IAM role/policy to lock down access to Secrets
+ Allocate a AWS EC2 instance from AWS Console.
+ Drop in deployment script in User Defined area
+ Start EC2 instance, verify domain join.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of AWS Cloud and assumes Teradici subscription, including the following:
+   [AWS Nvidia EC2 Instance](https://aws.amazon.com/nvidia/), including vCPUs, memory, disk, and GPUs
+   [Internet egress and transfer costs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-of-data-transfer-costs-for-common-architectures/), for PCoIP and other applications communications.

Use the [AWS pricing calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.

## Before you begin

In this section, you set up some basic resources that the tutorial depends on.

1. Instructions in this guide assume that you have a [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) 

1. Familiarize yourself with [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)

1. Understand [IAM roles for EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) 


## Creation of AWS Secrets

In this section, you create and configure a series of Secrets key/value pairs for authentication functions in scripts.

1. Access [AWS Secrets manager](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home?region=us-west-2#!/home) is region specfic, so enter the region you want to deploy EC2 instances. In this example we will be using *us-west-2*.

1. Select the **Store new secret** button in the upper-right hand corner of the page.

1. In the **New secrets creation** page, select:
    + In secret type: Select **Other type of secrets**.
    + In the Secrets key/value field create 2 key/vaule pairs: key named **ServiceAccount** with a AD user/service account that can add machines to AD.  Also a named **Password** and its assoicated the AD password created for the user/service created in AD.
    + Keep the Select the encryption key the default **DefaultEncryptionKey**

 1. In the **Store a new secret** page, select
    + In the Secret name field: Type **Windows/Service/DomainJoin**
    + (optionally) enter a description
    + (optionally) enter a Tag
    + Skip the Resource Permissions (optional) section for now, we will use IAM service role and policy instead. 
    + Select **Next** to continue

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/Secret_name.jpg)
    
 1. In the **Store a New Secret** page, take the default options then **Next** to continue.

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/StoreNewSecret.jpg)
    
 1. Confirm the setting for the new Secrets page, then **Store** to finish the creation of secrets.

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/ConfirmSecrets.jpg)
    
 1. Once the Secret has been successfully been created, you need to find its assoicated ARN. **Select** the newly created secret and **double-click** Secret Name.

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/List_Secrets.jpg)    
 
1. Once, In the **Secret Details** page, locate the ARN section and **copy** the associated ARN to later use in the IAM policy creation. 

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/Locate_ARN.jpg)
     
## Assign a IAM Policy for secrets

Create an IAM role for EC2 instance to read the secrets through the installation script to join the domain.

1. Go to IAM -> Policy -> Create Policy. 
    
1. Select the **Create Policy** button

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/Create_Policy_Button.jpg)
    
Select the **JSON** tab, it will open in separate web browser tab. Click on tab JSON and paste the following text. Also add in the **ARN** for the **Secrets** captured in the previous step when creating the secret.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:455311239824:secret:Windows/ServiceAccounts/DomainJoin-8KUbyW",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }    
    ]
}
```
1. Select Option tag then **Next** to continue

1. Review the setting to the IAM role, **Name** the Policy then select the **Create Policy** button to finish creating the role.

## Creation of a IAM Role to access policy

Within the IAM Management Console, select the **Create role** option. 

1. In the IAM Role section select **Create** Role button.

1. In the Role creation section, you will select the **AWS Service** and **EC2** under common use case.

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/Create_role.jpg)

1. Search for the already created Policy name, that was set in the previous step. *(Example: ec2_domain_join_script)*

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/Select_existing_role.jpg)
    
1. Next add optional Tags, Select **Next** to continue.

1. Finally, provide a name to the Role, review the Role and ensure the previous policy is assigned.

## Procure a EC2 Instance, assign role and use User Defined Script

In this section, you procure will procure a EC2 instance through the EC2 Dashboard. This section isn't an exhaustive explanation instead rather focusing on domain join script portion. For more details directions on the actual installation process, refer to [EC2 Nvidia](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/Teradici-PCoIP-Ultra-deployment-script-for-AWS-NVIDIA-EC2-instances) and [EC2 standard](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/Teradici-PCoIP-Standard-deployment-script-for-AWS-EC2-instances) installation guides.

1.  Launch a EC2 instance, On the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), choose **Launch Instance*

1. On the **Choose AMI** page, select the [Windows 2019 Base](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-bd6o47htpbnoe?ref=cns_srchrow) AMI, then press **Select** button.

1. On the **Choose Instance Type** page, chose a instance type and choose **Next: Configure Instance Details**.

1. On the **Configure Instance Details** page, at a minimum fill in **Networking/Subnet/Auto-Assign Public-IP** based on desired Network topology. Take remaining configuration details based your requirements, until you reach the **IAM Roles**, then select the name of the IAM role previous created. 
*(Example: Domain_Join_script)*

    ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/IAM_Role_Domain_Join.jpg)

    Scroll down to the **User data** field in the Advanced Details section and copy the script below and modify accordingly.

   ![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/Teradici-PCoIP-deployment_script-for-AWS-NVIDIA-Instances/blob/main/images/User_Data_Field.jpg)   
 
    ```
     <powershell>
    # Domain name and the tld. In this example would be teradici.dom
    $domain_name = "teradici".ToUpper()
    $domain_tld = "dom"
    $secrets_manager_secret_id = "Windows/ServiceAccounts/DomainJoin"

    # Make a request to the secret manager
    $secret_manager = Get-SECSecretValue -SecretId $secrets_manager_secret_id

    # Parse the response and convert the Secret String JSON into an object
    $secret = $secret_manager.SecretString | ConvertFrom-Json

    # Construct the domain credentials
    $username = $domain_name.ToUpper() + "\" + $secret.ServiceAccount
    $password = $secret.Password | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force

    # Set PS credentials
    $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username,$password)

    # Get the Instance ID from the metadata store, we will use this as our computer name during domain registration.
    $instanceID = [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostName()

    # Perform the domain join
    Add-Computer -DomainName "$domain_name.$domain_tld" -Credential $credential -Passthru -Verbose -Force -Restart
    </powershell>
    ```

If you used the same naming conventations throughout this deployment guide, then the only section you have to personalize is the name of your domain and its       assoicated tld. If you deviated the name of the secrets names or any other variables, then you should make the changes above as well  
    
+ Change to your domain name *Example: teradici* 
+ Chanage to your tld name *Examaple: dom*
    
    ```
    $domain_name = "teradici".ToUpper() 
    $domain_tld = "dom"                
    ```
  **Note, AD server( or) service is resolvable and accessable to the local subnet where instance resides, ensure all required ports are available.**
  
  For the remaining configuration details, make any selections you prefer. Then, choose **Next: Add Storage**.

5. On the **Add Storage** page, choose the Size (GiB) cell and increase the volume based on your requirements. Then, choose **Next: Add Tags**.

6. On the **Add Tags page**, optionally add any Key:Value tags to your instance. Then, choose **Next: Configure Security Group**.

7. On the Configure Security Group page, make the following selections:

    + For **Assign a security group**, choose **Create a new security group**.
    + For **Security group name**, type a descriptive name, such as *pcoip ssh rdp*.
    + For **Description**, optionally add a description.
    + For **Type**, choose **SSH**
    + For **Source**, choose **My IP**
    + Select **Add rule**
    + For **Type**, choose **Custom TCP Rule**
    + For **Port Range** choose **HTTPS**
    + For **Source**, choose **0.0.0.0/0**
    + Select **Add rule**
    + For **Type**, choose **Custom TCP Rule**
    + For **Port Range** choose **4172**
    + For **Source**, choose **0.0.0.0/0**
    + Select **Add rule**
    + For **Type**, choose **Custom UDP Rule**
    + For **Port Range** choose **4172**
    + For **Source**, choose **0.0.0.0/0**
    + Select **Add rule**
    + For **Type**, choose **Custom TCP Rule**
    + For **Port Range** choose **3389**
    + For **Source**, choose **My IP**
    
    Then, choose **Review** and **Launch**.
    
    **Note:** When the domain join script runs, it will AD join the instace using its instance ID as the AD computer name. Logging into the Active Directory Server     and looking for a correlation between instance ID and computer name ensures that the script has successfully run. 
    
## Revoke access to secrets after domain join

It is stronly recommended to remove access to the AWS secrets after you have succefully leveraged the domain join script. A savy end-user could theoretically access the AWS secrets while logged into an instance that still has granted access to the IAM role and they are aware ofthe Secrets Name to call in a function.  

**Option 1:** Apply an explicite Deny to the IAM role that overrides the IAM Policy orginally created**
1. From the [IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), select the **Role** option in the left pane. 

1. Search for the name of the Role that was previously created. *(Example: Domain_Join_script)*

1. Select the **Revoke** tab with the Role properties. 
    
![image](https://github.com/ChadSmithTeradici/DomainJoin-with-AWS-Secrets-for-Windows-EC2-instances/blob/main/images/Revoke_IAM_Role.jpg)

**Note:** An explicit DENY policy will override any ALLOW policies assinged to the same role. If you wanted to re-run the Domain Join script again and access the secrets, you would have to remove the DENY policy first.
    
**Option 2:** Remove the IAM Role on a per-instance basis through the EC2 Dashboard.

1. From [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), select the instances by **checking the box** left of the instances that just have been added to AD.

1. Select the **Actions** button, the **Security**, **Modify IAM Role**

1. In the Modify IAM Role window, select the **No IAM Role** option to remove access to secrets.
